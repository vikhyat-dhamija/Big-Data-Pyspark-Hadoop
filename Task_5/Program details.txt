task 5 :

We have taken input from the file provided with the recitation.

We have used the Mr JoB package in Python for hadoop streaming 

python filename -r hadoop is used for running this on the hadoop streaming.

The sample output screenshots are provided which are many of the total as the output was
much larger to present all the screenshots.

Logic of the program is that:

We have defined the mapper and reducer as seen in the class derived from the MR Job Class in Mr Job package

Mapper has to provide the values with respect to key so that based on the certain key the th values can be reduced to the desired output

here key is the output matrix row and col index and for that we need to have that row and col from the
multiplying matrices

Like for 1,1 we nned to have 1st whole row of A and 1st whole column of B

so for 1,2 we need to have first row of A and 2nd column of B

In order to pass values for getting the row, column output of the multplied result we need to make
that for example for 1,1 of the we create that first row is attached 1 and its row number is 1 and the column number will be index

So that means in case of multiplication we will produce 100 in our case(rank) values and similarly for the columns also and then we 
add the values based on the key created.

More logic can be easily comprehended by looking at the code.
